Relative to Opportunity
-----------------------

I completed my undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Science; GPA 4.0) in 2009 and completed a Graduate Diploma by Research Methods in 2011 (High Distinction average). I began my PhD in February 2012 and finished in April 2016, delivering a thesis with six published chapters and two published appendices. My PhD work provided new insights into mechanisms driving the distributions of blood parasites in wild birds. I also gained a broad understanding of coexistence theory and its applications to community ecology, for instance by providing evidence that interspecific parasite interactions can influence infection rates.

Following my PhD I have devoted much of my postdoctoral work to teaching and mentoring postgraduate research students. This has provided me with a set of leadership and organizational skills that I believe is unique among my peers. It also taught me to be proficient with the time that I do have available for research. Since winding down teaching in July last year, I have published seven papers and submitted another three, bringing my total to 19 publications. The quality and significance of this work is reflected by my exemplary publication record in some of the top journals in Ecology and Biogeography. My research has also garnered international recognition. I was invited to present work on new statistical tools for studying parasite niche differentiation at the Australian Society for Parasitology’s 2017 International Conference, where I was also invited to act as co-chair for a wildlife parasitology session. Recently, I have been invited to act as guest editor for a [*Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease* Special Issue](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/tropicalmed/special_issues/Medical_Geography) on disease patterns in a changing environment.
